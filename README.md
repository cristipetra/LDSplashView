# LDSplashView
A Swift class that can be used to animate a view to imitate an animated launch screen

LDSplashView is a simple class that can be used to create beautiful animated splash screens to be used while transitioning from the launch screen to the first view of your app. 

The splash view will allow you to create splash views with one of several pre-built animations. You can also add an icon on top of the splash screen such as your logo.
